Dear Diary, my dog Laika has been super hyper during this pandemic. Who know's what he's been up to? While I am trying my best to do homework, he keeps running around the house looking for peanut butter. I love him so much, but I do wish he would calm down! His ears are very cute and goes flop flop flop whenever we go out for a walk. He keeps me distracted during these difficult times, and for that I love him very much.
