A lot of  methods of predicting come out of wanting to make sense of the random — one thing that sticks out in my mind is my habit of trying to make sense of shapes in my retina before going to bed. It took me a while to realize that when you close your eyes, you see patterns and swirls from a phenomenon called [phosphenes](https://scienceline.org/2014/12/why-do-we-see-colors-with-our-eyes-closed/). What's really cool about this is that these patterns of light come from _inside your eyes_— just like how fireflies emit glow!

 Maybe I could try to find the digital equivalent for my digital life, which is all the more significant since most of my interaction happens online these days. Where do I leave daily ‘footprints’ in my digital day? What can those footprints tell me about the past, present, and future? What could be their method of ‘communicating’ to me?
 
## Self-Generated Prophecy 

Over two weeks, I collected all the data that I typed into my computer. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic lives we live in, where we are usually interacting with others through written communication online, I think this captured myself in a written format pretty well. (As well can be, anyhow.)

I used a Keylogger program named [Elite Keylogger](https://www.elitekeyloggers.com/elite-keylogger-mac). What this program was capturing was literally everything I was typing into my computer, namely these things:

- emails
- IM/social media/slack
- to do lists
- searching on browsers
- programming

## Transforming Data into Generative Format ##

I used GPT-2 to train my source data (txt) into a generative model that could give me paragraphs with these three prompts: "In the past, ", "In the present", and "In the future, ".

## The Output 

The output is a program that has a black user interface, prompting you to 

## Major Q: What do I want to predict? ##

I could make this into a random generator that produces an opaque-style oracle, something that needs to be interpreted for the meaning. Alternatively, I could just use data in a somewhat legible way to predict what I will be doing. 

## Some thoughts and memos via class 4/21/2020 ##

- Maybe what this is now missing is a formal process. Look through the methods that have been covered in the semester thus far. Who is the 'reader', who is the 'sitter'? 
- What constitutes 'meaning'?

## Some other thoughts after a week
- what does it mean to be self-surveilling? Doesn't religion talk about the all-knowing (or at least Santa Claus who claims to know everything naughty and good)? What makes predictive systems accurate? Is it the amount of data that is input? What makes us believe in these predictive systems? The amounts of data we put in? Our gullibility? Our belief systems?
- think about the querent and reader. Who is who? What is the role of the machine?
