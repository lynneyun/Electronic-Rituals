# Reading My Past, Present, and Future 

## Ideation

A lot of  methods of predicting come out of wanting to make sense of the random — one thing that sticks out in my mind is my habit of trying to make sense of shapes in my retina before going to bed. It took me a while to realize that when you close your eyes, you see patterns and swirls from a phenomenon called [phosphenes](https://scienceline.org/2014/12/why-do-we-see-colors-with-our-eyes-closed/). What's really cool about this is that these patterns of light come from _inside your eyes_— just like how fireflies emit glow!

 Maybe I could try to find the digital equivalent for my digital life, which is all the more significant since most of my interaction happens online these days. Where do I leave daily ‘footprints’ in my digital day? What can those footprints tell me about the past, present, and future? What could be their method of ‘communicating’ to me?
 
## Self-Generated Prophecy 

Over two weeks, I collected all the data that I typed into my computer. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic lives we live in, where we are usually interacting with others through written communication online, I think this captured myself in a written format pretty well. (As well can be, anyhow.)

I used a Keylogger program named [Elite Keylogger](https://www.elitekeyloggers.com/elite-keylogger-mac). What this program was capturing was literally everything I was typing into my computer, namely these things:

- emails
- IM/social media/slack
- to do lists
- searching on browsers
- programming

## Transforming Data into Generative Format ##

I used GPT-2 to train my source data (txt) into a generative model that could give me paragraphs with these three prompts: "In the past, ", "In the present", and "In the future, ".

## The Past, Present, and Future Oracle

The output is a program that has a black user interface, prompting you to click in order to 'see' as the querent and reader. Upon clicking with your mouse, you can see a glimpse into what the oracle is telling you. You'll notice that the text stops after it reaches the edge of the circle; to read on you'll have to click around to reveal more of the text. 

However, as you click further, you'll see that the text starts to overlap with the existing text on the screen, ultimately decreasing the readability. This is a pretty apt outcome, referring to that trying to read too much into oracles often confuses the querent. 

There are three main options you have with the oracle: Past, Present, and Future. Selecting each will give you different types of readings that correspond to your wish.
